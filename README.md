# quickanalysis

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of quickanalysis is quickly analyze any measured numeric
variable across multiple treatments, and want a quick summary statistics
and visualization of the data. The `box_and_stats()` function provides
fast summary statistics (min, max, mean, median, standard deviation) of
the measured variable for each treatment, along with a boxplot which
displays the data visually.

## Installation

quickanalysis is not on CRAN, but you can download it from my github
repository. Use the follwoing R command to download it:

``` r
 devtools::install_github("marquenis/quickanalysis") 
```

## Example

This is a basic example of how the package works using the R dataset
iris. This dataset contains a measured variable (Sepal.length) across
multiple categorical treatments (in this case, species).

``` r
library(quickanalysis)

box_and_stats(iris, Species, Sepal.Length)
#> [[1]]
```

    #> 
    #> [[2]]
    #> # A tibble: 3 Ã— 6
    #>   fun_treatment   min   max  mean median    SD
    #>   <fct>         <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl>
    #> 1 setosa          4.3   5.8  5.01    5   0.352
    #> 2 versicolor      4.9   7    5.94    5.9 0.516
    #> 3 virginica       4.9   7.9  6.59    6.5 0.636

This package is special because you can easily do all that jazz

## Notes

One interesting thing about this package is it relies on ggplot2, dplyr,
and magrittr
