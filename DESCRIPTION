Description: This package is oriented towards people who are looking to analyze
    any measured numeric variable across multiple treatments, and want a quick 
    summary statistics and visualization of the data. The `box_and_stats()`
    function provides fast summary statistics (min, max, mean, median, standard
    deviation) of the measured variable for each treatment, along with a boxplot 
    which displays the data visually.
